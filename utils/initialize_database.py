While cereal and milk share some similarities with soup, such as being a mixture of solid and liquid ingredients, the key difference lies in their preparation and consumption.

However, freezers are usually smaller and less frequently accessed, so they may not have a built-in light. Additionally, the cold temperature in the freezer can make it more difficult and expensive to install and maintain lighting.""",
